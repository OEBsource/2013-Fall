Data and scripts for the fall SOURCE course.

During this course we'll deal with some of the basics of R coding.
We are open to any additional input from the class so if you'd like to present something interesting that you did in R, let us know!

To download our files in Github, click on the file, then right-click 'Raw' on the right side of the data.
Select 'save as' to download to your computer.
